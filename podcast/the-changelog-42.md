* [Asset handling](https://github.com/wycats/rails_assets) is coming in Rails 3.1, meaning better support for [Sass](http://thechangelog.com/post/254788034/episode-0-0-1-haml-sass-and-compass), [Compass](http://thechangelog.com/post/254788034/episode-0-0-1-haml-sass-and-compass), and [CoffeeScript](http://thechangelog.com/post/849754840/episode-0-2-9-coffeescript-with-jeremy-ashkenas)
